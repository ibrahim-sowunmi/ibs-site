<h1>Who are you from a neurological perspective</h1>
<p>It’s a pretty solid question. I was sat between a few friends, both agnostic, as they were arguing about the sense of self. The argument stemmed from one of the agnostic guys questioning the notion of self from a religious perspective. He couldn’t wrap his head around a religious persons belief that the “self” of this world is relatively arbitrary compared to the self that would exist in the afterlife. He had a relatively confident belief in his sense of self. Over confidence in my opinions. This led to the age old “who/what am i”. The classic question. Someone has to throw in a bit of daycart when arguing this, or are we even educated.</p>
<p>I remember being 17 and talking with my neighbour about the concept of me. She said to me if I chop off my arm. Am I still me? Of course you are I replied. What about my leg. Of course you are. My nose. Of course you are. And this continuously back and forth until I thought. Fuck? What am i? This is the first time I cared enough to have an existential crisis. The days, weeks and years went by but that gnawing sensation of the “fuck am I” never really abated. Luckily for me I picked the weirdest computer science undergraduate known to man in human computer interaction. and really enjoyed my psychology modules. So much so that whenever given the choice on what modules to pick between the computer science, psychology and biology components of my degree (HCI is weird). I would always hone in on the psychology, especially the neuroscience. It baffled me, intrigued me and in all honesty, gave me a fair amount of joy that human nature could be boiled down to neurons, glials and action potentials.</p>
<p>As my friends were sat there discussing self from a philosophical perspective I perked up, ready to share my knowledge from an undergraduate degree and an enthusiasts interest in neuroscience, hours of listening to lectures, reading in my own time and listening to podcasts. I spluttered out some superficial knowledge on the corpus calloseum and was summarily ignored. Okay, I thought, these guys have no idea what I’m talking about. Let me collect my thoughts and rephrase it in a digestible manner. I took a moment aaaaaand blank. Just a vague collection of notions, and bite sized statement about different brain areas. Frustrated, I let the conversation come to its natural end and that was that.</p>
<p>I made a mental note to revise my knowledge on this topic and share it in a bite sized post. Hopefully this is that post. I want to go over a few major and minor brain areas and think about what the effect of removing each of these has.</p>
