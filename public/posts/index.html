<h1>Thing I intend to accomplish - FY22</h1>
Writing up a plan for things I want to accomplish over the year of 2022. Divided into sections
Physical
- Splits
o So I don‚Äôt tax myself. I will be dedicating my time in the gym during the months of Jan, Feb & March exclusively to achieving a straddle split. Working on my flexibility has been something I‚Äôve been working on doing intermittently for a long time. It‚Äôs come in spurts and burst that usually haven‚Äôt lasted for longer than a month and a half before I get bored.

<h1>The CV guide I wish I had</h1>
Hello Reader,
Imagine this. You‚Äôre 18. You have no experience and what feels like no skills. You‚Äôre flung into an environment ¬≠¬≠where, unbeknownst to many people, you‚Äôre building the foundation for the rest of your life. Well what do you do?
This dude says get some experience&mldr; That dude said build a CV&mldr; That other other dude said leverage your network? The f*** does that even mean? It is confusing. Fortunately, you‚Äôve got a lot of time to think and a good head on your shoulders.

<h1>You are what you consume</h1>
Hello Reader,
I never thought of myself as a social media addict, but COVID shook that belief a little. Suddenly, cooped up at home for months, ‚Äúreal life time‚Äù with friends was replaced with virtual time on Twitter, Youtube (The commentsüò≠), Reddit, etc. As time went on, I became more aware of the insidiousness of what was happening to me. By spending all day scrolling, swiping, commenting, I was becoming what I consume, what I was paying attention to.

<h1>Elon Musk kinda sucks</h1>
I‚Äôm not a fan of Elon musk here‚Äôs why
Over Elon musk for various reasons, rich, intelligent, nerdy (Into crypto with BTC-DOGE), charming bumbling man (Disarming- think trump, bojo), neoliberal (Capitalist boner, anti-government (There are no human rights on mars babyyy)), cares about the climate because he&rsquo;s pushing EVs(He doesn&rsquo;t give a fuck), inspired ironman (Nerdy appeal again), Snake oil salesman (Using self driving, which he repeatedly fails to deliver on as level 5 autonomous driving is 100% impossible right now, as a means to push valuations up, again by selling it to &ldquo;little/lay people&rdquo; investors, who may get burned).

<h1>Financial literacy for big dummies</h1>
Hello Reader,
I&rsquo;ve decided to start blogging An absolutely fruitless endeavour akin to screaming in the wind, but anyone who knows me well knows that engaging in fruitless endeavours has become something of a passion of late. Especially as I‚Äôm about to enter the work world &ldquo;for real for real&rdquo;, I don‚Äôt want to be a passionless bozo.
The decision to try a bunch of random stuff. Such as blogging, has been triggered by expendable income, irrespective of that I‚Äôve always been a bit of a curious cat.

<h1>My perspective on intelligence</h1>
If you‚Äôve been following this blog for a while you‚Äôve seen I‚Äôve added and removed a fair few number of posts. One of the topics I‚Äôve wrote about was in intelligence. Liquid IQ, Crystal IQ, Brain specialisations, Cultural differences. There‚Äôs a lot that could potentially be discussed around intelligence. For me these things all play a role and people, especially young people, and dumb people. Overuse intelligence. As people we‚Äôre addicted to labelling, it‚Äôs how we navigate the world and we do it compulsively.

<h1>Power of Twitter</h1>
I don‚Äôt like social media. Never been a fan of it. Don‚Äôt think I ever will be. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs extremely useful. As I I‚Äôve mentioned in previous posts I‚Äôm at a transitory period of my life. I‚Äôm going from an incubatory phase to an explorative one. Something I‚Äôve noticed whilst looking around for the next big thing is network is important. I‚Äôve always known it‚Äôs important but it‚Äôs even MORE important than I initially thought.

<h1>Who are you from a neurological perspective</h1>
It‚Äôs a pretty solid question. I was sat between a few friends, both agnostic, as they were arguing about the sense of self. The argument stemmed from one of the agnostic guys questioning the notion of self from a religious perspective. He couldn‚Äôt wrap his head around a religious persons belief that the ‚Äúself‚Äù of this world is relatively arbitrary compared to the self that would exist in the afterlife. He had a relatively confident belief in his sense of self.

<h1>Beginnings</h1>
I&rsquo;ve decided to start blogging, kind of. I intially wrote this during my final year of university. As of today 2022-1-11, I&rsquo;m rebuilding this site. It starteed out with the intention of being a blog/CV and now it&rsquo;s a hobby project. Continue reading for a throwback to my original thought process. A year later and it already makes me cringe slightly despite there being little to no change in me. :/
