<h1>Financial literacy for big dummies</h1>
<p>Hello Reader,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to start blogging
An absolutely fruitless endeavour akin to screaming in the wind, but anyone who knows me well knows that engaging in fruitless endeavours has become something of a passion of late. Especially as I’m about to enter the work world &ldquo;for real for real&rdquo;, I don’t want to be a passionless bozo.</p>
<p>The decision to try a bunch of random stuff. Such as blogging, has been triggered by expendable income, irrespective of that I’ve always been a bit of a curious cat. This mindset has led to many poor social and financial decisions but we move. Okay! Enough rambling! Why am I doing this?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s primarily to tame section a little of this highly centralised beast known as the internet (pronounced intahnet) and make it my own. I wanted something similar to social media but not as likely to suck me in and a little more fun to curate/create. The solution is obviously to build it yourself. I also wanted something more extensible than medium and more fun than Wordpress. It’s also a little bit of a testament to my technical vanity ngl (or maybe a calling to get a life).</p>
<p>The current state of the site is a static webpage. This is not the ideal end state but alas I am too lazy to spin up an EC2 to host (and too cheap). as I’m dilly dallying doing this little thing called a degree. EDIT: degree done will move to EC2 when bored.</p>
<p>This blog serves to</p>
<ol>
<li>Organise my thoughts</li>
<li>provide insight into my thoughts for whatever poor soul wishes that upon themselves</li>
<li>share some of my photos/art/cool shit I find</li>
<li>Provide a sort of digital vetting</li>
<li>Finally, for agency over my own data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Looking at things people have produced online is not something one would traditionally classify as a passion but it&rsquo;s something that I and most people, do a lot. It’s pretty much compulsive at this stage. Paired with guide my guiding philosophy for life, (connection and production (logotherapy - Viktor E Frankl)) it&rsquo;s made me want to share some.</p>
<p>I do a solid amount of journaling, tons of note taking. Doing it in a manner that isn’t as Blaise as my journal or academic as my notes strikes a healthy balance to me.</p>
<p>Special influence: Jamie Tanna’s post about the indie web here inspired me a little. And Khoi Vin&rsquo;s Interview here about how he started blogging.</p>
<p>The intention is to do a post a week of 250 - 500 words, on any topic that tickles my fancy really. It’s one those things that should make me a better person? Edit: Failed this horrendously, second try now (2/11/21)!</p>
