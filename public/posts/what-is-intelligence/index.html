<h1>My perspective on intelligence</h1>
<p>If you’ve been following this blog for a while you’ve seen I’ve added and removed a fair few number of posts. One of the topics I’ve wrote about was in intelligence. Liquid IQ, Crystal IQ, Brain specialisations, Cultural differences. There’s a lot that could potentially be discussed around intelligence. For me these things all play a role and people, especially young people, and dumb people. Overuse intelligence. As people we’re addicted to labelling, it’s how we navigate the world and we do it compulsively. This obsession with labelling is a whole other thing but one of the things we like to do is label people as smart or dumb. Usually in those two distinct buckets with a small grey area in between. If someone is articulate, knowledgeable about certain areas, gets good grades, earns a lot of money, went to/or worked at a well respected institution we instantly assume they’re intelligent. That is very much so not the case. I’m sure there’s a correlation but we if we were to sit down and map these things in a chart. I’m sure someone has somewhere and if you find something please let me know. It would paint a very different narrative. I talk to a family member at times and he has this deeply saddening self belief that he’s stupid. It’s frustrating to witness and it’s also self perpetuating. One of the best things he can do to “become more intelligent”, is to feign intelligence. Think of life as a video game where you have an intelligence stat, what can you do to raise that stat. That liquid intelligence that I mentioned previously, some people have that, their memory’s are great, mental maths is fantastic, able to easily visual complex 3D structures mentally. Some people have that. In my opinion those skips can be learnt to appear as good at if not better than 95% of people. That’s what I find frustrating. The fact that thinking like that about intelligence makes you stupider! Almost more so than anything else. If you suffered from really poor memory, like living life in a constant haze of retrograde amnesia. Then sure, I admit you may have a tough time. On the other hand if you’re a neuronormative individual then attacking that probably intelligently is completely within your grasp. If you’re suffering from some ailment or really young, then fair enough.</p>
