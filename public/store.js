          <b>What’s the point of this site?</b>
          <br>
          <br>I started this to create a bit of a digital presence (No
          socials bar Linkedin). I’ve been meaning to write about random things
          for a while, and I got tired of my ideas/thoughts stacking up in my
          brain and gradually fading into nothing.<br>
          Also, writing is just a good skill to have! I don't write much as I've
          been on the STEM fast track, and during Uni all the writing I did felt
          like typing with my toes. This site is an attempt to develop that part
          of my brain a bit (not the toe typing part).

            I enjoy travelling, keeping fit (
            <i>Boxing, Running, Calisthenics, Gym</i>
            ), philosophizing, learning and thinking about things like
            geopolitics, finance, crypto, urban/environmental sustainability,
            digital art, photography, software engineering, neuroscience,
            economics, technology, etc. When I'm not doing something related to
            those, I'm likely working through my{' '}
