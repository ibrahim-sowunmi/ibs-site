description: "I’ve been putting of writing a post like this myself, because I felt that maybe I just didn’t understand blockchain technology well enough. That maybe I should read yet another whitepaper, join another Discord. Buy some ether.
I am a studied computer scientist with a nontrivial amount of experience. One main issue I have with Web3 from that perspective is that it’s just bad engineering.”
My current hypothesis is that everything blockchain is like a combination of a pyramid scheme, scientology, Tamagotchi, a lottery and a lot of words trying to obfuscate that. It definitely doesn’t deserve the name Web3, because it has little to do with the actual World Wide Web."
