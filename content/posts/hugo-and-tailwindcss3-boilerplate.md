After starting a Hugo and TailwindCSS project. I got stuck super regularly. A well-placed blog page could have alleviated a lot of my pain. When working with Tailwind and Hugo my config setups never worked. 

I am pretty sure I know what went wrong, and it tended to be some pretty simplistic mistakes. There are Tailwindcss3/Hugo repos out there, that let you sidestep these initial teething problems.

[Here's a link to the one I used](https://github.com/4044ever/Hugo-Tailwind-3.0)

'Prose' is nice for readable format btw. I suggest going over the typography prose documentation, instead of facepalming after getting stuck wondering how to style content like a prose text block. 🤦🏾‍♂️
