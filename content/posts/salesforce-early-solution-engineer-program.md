>  Writing this up because I remember being curious about what this job entailed and finding zero testimonials. You can reach out on linkedIn but this is easier.

Firstly, if you've come across this blog you're probably wondering what am I getting into. You've likely had limited to no interaction 

#### 1. Wage

The ultimate reason 9/10 of us work. A question on everyones mind. It's good, with good progression (am I allowed to say this?). Next.

#### 2. Mobility and growth opportunities within the company

The program itself is meant to springboard you into being a solution engineer. If you don't know what that is checkout my previous post about it here. You join on the program.

#### 3. Workplace flexibility and schedule control

You have a lot of free time

#### 4. Benefits

Compensation package aside. It's a years training. Paid as a full-time employee. Among all my friends 

#### 5. Working conditions

Pretty chill dawg.
