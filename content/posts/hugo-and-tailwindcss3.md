As I've said many times before I got stuck super regularly. A well placed blog page could have alleviated a lot of my pain. I wanted to start a Hugo and TailwindCSS project. When working with tailwing and hugo my config setups never worked. 

I am pretty sure I know what went wrong and it was a pretty stupid mistake but there are tailwindcss3 and hugo repos out there you can use as a boilerplace

[Here's a link to the one I used](https://github.com/4044ever/Hugo-Tailwind-3.0)

Prose is nice for readable format btw. I suggest going over the typography prose documentation instead of facepalming after getting stuck wondering how to style  content like a prose text block. 🤦🏾‍♂️
