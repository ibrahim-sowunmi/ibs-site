I suck at demos. So let's distill some of my notes and learn together.

Practicing over and over again

Prep to demo ratio, if I were to give a number. That final stage post RFP big demo would be from 3 - 8 hours prepping for a 1 - 3 hour demo. A lot more prep for demo.

2-5x more time demo prepping than demoing. Having a repository is much better. 

After getting that invite. We have a discovery or an AE provides high quality notes. We always aim for a discovery though. You want to be on the same page as the AE in terms of what we are presenting. 

How well can I do those things? How well does the tool solve our problems? How do we configure this? How do we set it up?

Step 1: See if we're capabale

Step 2: Start playing around

 Getting on the same page with AEs is very important

Sometimes when things can't be done admitted to a customer it can't be done, helps build that trust

The qualified no, try to understand why you want that feature 

After which we cut the fat

If it takes 10 steps to solve a problem, what can we cut out to minimise the number of steps. eg; when watching someone fill out a survey or a questionnaire is a waste of time. How do we highlight a few questions, with not much infromation behind. We want to deliver value in a certain way. Where we can highlight a feature without haveing to necesasarily talk about it again. 

We want to boil it down to stage data. When doing a demo we cherry pick the pieces. We want to prove the value, we don't want to prove every mouse click. 

SOmetimes it's better to preload content. We want to minimise the effect of making things feel complicated. 

Figuring out what is required to focus on during the call. How do you make the deicison, to figure out what provides value and what deosnt's provide value.

Part of that comes down to being a storyteller, and knowing what matter and what doens't matter. SOmetimes we have to over demo, a feature so we cna buiold credibility and apply info on it later. 

Overdemo initially to build trust sometimes, so that yes is enough. Build credibility.
