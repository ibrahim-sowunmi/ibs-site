description: The OG blog post and the beginning for ibrahimsowunmi.com
summary: I've decided to start blogging, kind of. I intially wrote this during my final year of university. As of today 2022-1-11, I'm rebuilding this site. It starteed out with the intention of being a blog/CV and now it's a hobby project. Continue reading for a throwback to my original thought process. A year later and it already makes me cringe slightly despite there being little to no change in me. :/

# I've decided to start blogging.

Kind of fruitless in this day and age. Everything being concentrated on social media and whatnot, but I've learnt a lot from blogs. Plus, it's always nice to come across a good blog. Whether it belongs to someone you know or for educational material. 

As I’m about to enter the working world "for real for real", I don’t want to be a passionless, uninteresting bozo. The way to avoid this, imo, is to try a bunch of random stuff and see what sticks. Blogging is one of these. This mindset has led to many poor social and financial decisions but we move. Let dive a bit deeper into...

## Why I'm doing this.

It's primarily to tame a little section of this highly centralised beast known as the internet and make it my own. I wanted something similar to social media but not as likely to suck me in and a little more fun to curate/create. The solution is obviously to build it yourself. I also wanted something more extensible than medium and more fun than Wordpress. It’s also a little bit of a testament to my technical vanity ngl (or maybe a calling to get a life 🤷🏿‍♂️).

The current state of the site is a static webpage. This is not the ideal end state but alas I am too lazy to spin up an EC2 to host (and too cheap). as I’m dilly dallying doing this little thing called a degree. 

> FUTURE-EDIT: Degree done will move to EC2 when bored.

> FUTURE-EDIT2: Fuck EC2. Moved it to jamstack and netlify, makes a lot more sense.

### This blog serves to

1. Organise my thoughts
2. Share my thoughts
3. Share cool shit I find (or maybe make?)
4. Digital vetting (I still exist guys)
5. Agency over my own digital representation

Looking at things people have produced online is not something one would traditionally classify as a passion but it's something that everyone does, a lot. Think of the ratio of content consumers to producers. It's probably in your favour to produce something. Even if only to get into the mindset. Paired with some guiding beliefs of mine it's really made me want to share some/create something cool.

​      I do a solid amount of journaling, tons of note taking. Doing it in a manner that isn’t as blaise as a journal or as academic as my notes strikes me as a healthy balance.

Special influence: Jamie Tanna’s post about the indie web [Here](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/10/20/indieweb-talk/) inspired me a little. And Khoi Vin's Interview [Here](https://ownyourcontent.wordpress.com/2019/05/14/khoi-vinh-on-how-his-blog-amplified-his-work-and-career/) about how his blog has affected his life

The intention is to do a post a week of 250 - 500 words, on any topic that tickles my fancy. It’s one those things thats supposedly should make me a better person? 

>  FUTURE-EDIT: Failed this horrendously, second try now (2/11/21)!
