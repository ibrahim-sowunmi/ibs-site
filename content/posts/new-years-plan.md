Writing up a plan for things I want to accomplish over the year of 2022. Divided into sections

 

Physical

\-    Splits

o  So I don’t tax myself. I will be dedicating my time in the gym during the months of Jan, Feb & March exclusively to achieving a straddle split. Working on my flexibility has been something I’ve been working on doing intermittently for a long time. It’s come in spurts and burst that usually haven’t lasted for longer than a month and a half before I get bored. This time I aim to power through the tedium

\-    Running

o  Running just feels great. Hyping myself up to do it kind of sucks. The constant injures afterwards sucks. The running itself is great. The pressure on my joints not so much. The affect on the heart is the greatest. Plus simulating that physical stress is fantastic for mental health. I wil start running EXTREMELY lighly. To east myself into it. I can do a 5k in about 30 minutes. Which is pretty amateur. I aim to ease into 5k in 30 mins comfortably. I can currently do it but ie leaves me a bit gassed. Rather than recklessly pushing forward to the next milestone I’d rather consolidate my current level

\-    Boxing

o  Starting this again in Ireland. I’ve gone to one session in Dublin, where I pulled a muscle due to over exertion, surprise surprise. I’m not as spry as I once was and I’m only 24.. ffs. Going to go again and take it easy. Leave my ego outside the gum.

\-    Gym

o  One session a week. Gym body for the ladies n that.

 

Career

\-    4X Salesforce Certified

o  3 will come naturally. Pushing for that 4th

o  Admin, App builder, Advanced admin, Platform Developer (TBC)

\-    Pass the ESE program successfully

o  Yeah if I don’t do this, someone give me a bell. Mental health will be a shambles. Even if I sound like I’m good haha.

Social

\-    Keep contact with people

o  “Relationships are an investment from your end as much as other peoples” – Therapist lady

Mental

\-    Less anxious

o  I have no clue when this became a thing. It certainly wasn’t prior to university. I get very anxious now. It’s annoying. I kind of miss that emotional disconnect I was able to display with that emotion. I may just be more aware of when I feel anxious, and think about it more as opposed to powering through.

\-    Plan better

\-    Second Language

o  I’ve never felt more linguistically inept than I have this year. I started the year as part of a Salesforce graduate cohort of 56. Of that 56 I am aware or 7 that do not speak a second language. They’re all from either the UK or Ireland. I want to make that six. I intend to learn Spanish (Again) and previously I flopped after two years due to exam and dissertation pressures. The marathon exam crunch era of my life has come to an end, I’ve decided. I will without a doubt be burdened, stressed and burnout at certain points of my life. But now I’ll be burnt out around a routine. I may as well leverage the monotonous system that is my day-to-day life to allow me to communicate with a few hundred million other people. I have 1 or 2 willing Spanish practice partners and a friend who’s starting the journey at the same time as me, with the same intention as me, to keep me accountable.

Financial

\-    Get into crypto 

o  I’m kind of into it already. I could have a very rudimentary conversation about web3 and tokenimics but it’s more from a macroeconomic/philosophical perspective. So, I’m high key waffling/speculating/hating on current systems.

\-    Engage more with crypto

o  This is a crazy high turnover industry that seems a few years of evolution every few months with project spawning and crumbing, very much Wild West. Similarly, to the wild west there’s snake oil salesmen about but hopefully I won’t be singed. Luckily, I have a community of people around me who have been navigating, quite successfully, for a fair amount of time longer that me. Tapping into that whilst also engaging more with discord and Twitter will be pivotal for my success in this I’m guessing. So getting down and dirty with the these crypto nerds will be pretty important.

\-    Segment your money

o  I am young. As a percentage of my lifetime income the money I’m earning now (will hopefully) shouldn’t be too much money. I intend to splurge for 2022 as this year has placed me within a network in a location that allows me to do more this year with my money and to get some experience that will be a pain in the ass to purchase. I want a year where I have fun. I have my entirely life to be frugal and (although 1 blip of a year) I have been most of the time. This year I should have enough capital to be relatively frugal whilst having a decent time.

\-    Spend frugally (No more 3X takeaway nights in a week)

Spiritual

\-    

Community

\-    Become engaged with a volunteering community

o  Regularly engage in some form of outreach. It doesn’t matter where it stems from. For the past few months, I have been mentoring two kids and it has been enjoyable. I would like to increase my engagement but finding a community is difficult. You would think I’m this day and age and you could pop onto google type volunteering and the algorithm delivers a cornucopia of companies gagging for your almighty input. But alas it’s not that easy. There’s company outreach which is cool but doing something separate to that would also be cool. If you have or know of anything in London/Dublin and think I may be able to help. Please do not hesitate to reach out.
