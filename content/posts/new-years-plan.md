description: Focus for the next year
summary: A list of things I'll be focusing on in the upcoming year. I usually send these to myself 1 year ahead with the futureme email service. At the end of most year I just receive an email from my past self holding my current self accountable. This is essentially that

Writing up a plan for things I want to accomplish over the year of 2022. Divided into sections

 

## Physical

### Splits

So I don’t tax myself. I will be dedicating my time in the gym during the months of Jan, Feb & March primarily to achieving a straddle split. Working on my flexibility has been something I’ve been working on doing intermittently for a long time. It’s come in spurts and burst that usually haven’t lasted for longer than a month and a half before I get bored. This time I aim to power through.

### Running

Running just feels great. Hyping myself up to do it kind of sucks. The constant injures afterwards sucks. The running itself is great. The pressure on my joints not so much. The affect on the heart is the greatest. Plus simulating that physical stress is fantastic for mental health. I wil start running EXTREMELY lighly. To east myself into it. I can do a 5k in about 30 minutes, although it leaves me nicely winded afterwards. Which is pretty amateur. I aim to ease into 5k in 30 mins, comfortably. Rather than recklessly pushing forward to the next milestone I’d rather consolidate my current level of fitness

### Boxing

Or any other contact sport. Starting this again in Ireland. I’ve gone to one session in Dublin, where I pulled a muscle due to over exertion, surprise surprise. I’m not as fit as I once was and I’m only 24, ffs. Going to go again and take it easy. Leave my ego outside the gym. Aim is to start in march.

### Gym

One session a week. Gym body for the ladies and that.

## Career

### 4X Salesforce Certified

- 3 will come naturally. Pushing for that 4th
- Admin, App builder, Advanced admin, Platform Developer (TBC)

### Pass the ESE program successfully

- If I don’t do this, someone give me a bell. Mental health will be a shambles. Even if I sound like I’m good haha.

## Social

\-    Keep contact with people

## Mental 

### Be less anxious

I have no clue when this became a thing. It certainly wasn’t prior to university. I get very anxious now. It’s annoying. I kind of miss that emotional disconnect I was able to display with that emotion. I may just be more aware of when I feel anxious, and think about it more as opposed to powering through.

### Plan better

This is the most important thing on this list by far.

### B1 level in a Second Language

## Financial

### Get into crypto 

I’m kind of into it already. I could have a very rudimentary conversation about web3, Staking, LP, DAOs and tokenimics but I'm on the lowest of lows waffling.

### Engage more with crypto

This is a crazy high turnover industry that seems a few years of evolution every few months with project spawning and crumbing, very much Wild West. Similarly, to the wild west there’s snake oil salesmen about but hopefully I won’t be singed. Luckily, I have a community of people around me who have been navigating through the cryptoverse, quite successfully, for a fair amount of time longer that me. Tapping into that, whilst also engaging more with discord and Twitter communities, .will be vital for my success in this, I’m guessing.

### Segment your money

 I am young. As a percentage of my lifetime income the money I’m earning now (will hopefully) shouldn’t be too much money. I intend to splurge for 2022 as this year has placed me within a network in a location that allows me to do more this year with my money and to get some experience that will be a pain in the ass to purchase. I want a year where I have fun. I have my entirely life to be frugal and (although 1 blip of a year) I have been most of the time. This year I should have enough capital to be relatively frugal whilst having a decent time.

\-    Spend frugally (No more 3X takeaway nights in a week)

Spiritual

Community

\-    Become engaged with a volunteering community

o  Regularly engage in some form of outreach. It doesn’t matter where it stems from. For the past few months, I have been mentoring two kids and it has been enjoyable. I would like to increase my engagement but finding a community is difficult. You would think I’m this day and age and you could pop onto google type volunteering and the algorithm delivers a cornucopia of companies gagging for your almighty input. But alas it’s not that easy. There’s company outreach which is cool but doing something separate to that would also be cool. If you have or know of anything in London/Dublin and think I may be able to help. Please do not hesitate to reach out.
