## I’m not a fan of Elon musk here’s why

Over Elon musk for various reasons, rich, intelligent, nerdy (Into crypto with BTC-DOGE), charming bumbling man (Disarming- think trump, bojo), neoliberal (Capitalist boner, anti-government (There are no human rights on mars babyyy)), cares about the climate because he's pushing EVs(He doesn't give a fuck), inspired ironman (Nerdy appeal again), Snake oil salesman (Using self driving, which he repeatedly fails to deliver on as level 5 autonomous driving is 100% impossible right now, as a means to push valuations up, again by selling it to "little/lay people" investors, who may get burned). The market is currently more accessible, more irrational and has more capital floating about than ever before and he is taking full advantage of that as the "Celebrity CEO" archetype. I'm a justified hater. He accelerated the push to EVs, so fair enough for that, but the general opinion of him is still massively out of touch with reality.
