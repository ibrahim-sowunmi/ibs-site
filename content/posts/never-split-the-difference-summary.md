# Never Split The Difference

## Key Takeaways:

* Take it slow
* Remain calm
* Anchor
* Haggling is a dance



Mirroring - A surpsingly good conversational technique. When talking to someone repeat the last 1 - 3 words of their statement in the reply. People feel like their being listened to and are more open to continuing conversation.

Establish rapport & Empathise - When you're in a negotiation, rather than thinking, I want X. Think about the other persons perspective. Think about why they can or can't give you what they want. How they feel and how to change their feelings as opposed to convincing them. This is a slight change but makes a world of different conceptually.

Labelling - Say how they are feeling our loud to get confirmation as to how they're feeling. "You're feeling sad", and use that as springboard to get to the route of their emotion.

Accusation auditing - "You think I'm trying to take advantage of you". A technique within establishing 

Slow down - There shouldn't be a sense of urgency in negotation. Negotiating makes people uncomfortable. They want it to end. The longer it goes on the more flexible people are.

Don't be afraid of no, a gradual yes

The three voices - When negotiating three voices should be used 

* FM DJ voice - Smooth calm and collected, to pacify
* Assertion - Let them know you know your shit, your a voice of authority
* Playfulness - A smile in your voice be friendly get everyone comfortable, use sparingly as it can come off as condescending

That's right is better than yes. Yes can sometimes be flippant. When someone says yes, it may be simple to get you to agree, when somsone says that right it's due to you pinpointing their issue and establishing that empathetic connection to them. Think about when someone is bothering you, you just say, "yes", to get them them to f off. Compared to a that's right, which on a fundamental level means the same thing, but again it means so much more.
