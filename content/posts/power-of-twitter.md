I don’t like social media. Never been a fan of it. Don’t think I ever will be. Unfortunately, it’s extremely useful. As I I’ve mentioned in previous posts I’m at a transitory period of my life. I’m going from an incubatory phase to an explorative one. Something I’ve noticed whilst looking around for the next big thing is network is important. I’ve always known it’s important but it’s even MORE important than I initially thought. When someone says networking to me. I think of a professional network. As in I goto work, or have friends with good jobs, that work with (or are) someone useful in some way. Twitters network is useful. Every social media network is “useful”. I just think that twitters is the best for generating a marketable following. I was recently reading about Tony dinhs success with creating a SaaS product and getting it to 3K MRR. Which is impressive. You have a software success like that, scale it successfully, maintain it and you’re set for a good while. After digging through his site and on his blog the thing that gave him that virtual slap on the butt when kickstarting his product was his twitter following. I’m not particularly smart, particularly insightful or original. I do believe I can succesfully regurgitate enough content in my own words sprinkled with enough value and authenticity, to give the impression I am though. I’ve started this slowly with my blog (which doesn’t have much content/isn’t particularly well written) and I intend to get better with it over time. Writing on random topics that interest me and sharing snippets of it online. Like a mini blog that I’ll use to inform the thoughts of my personal blog. Who knows.
