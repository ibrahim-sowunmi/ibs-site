I see something new I want to learn I start doing it. I spend a little time learning how I'm supposed to learn it. Then I do it. Golden rule of learning things, I've noticed. 

I scanned through the hugo documentation at lightning speed. Then watched this [Followed along this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtIqKaDlqXo&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3). 

I didn't need to understand everything in it. Everything is useful though as these are the fundamentals. I have no doubt I will have to go through my code and refactor based on stuff that I missed.

Then I watched this guys [video on starting your own hugo theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcMqrb3v2SM) as I wanted something without a theme. Stripped the project down. The stuff in this is all in the documentation but sometimes extra hand holding is nice. 

From there you're good to go and you have a foundation.
