# **The Six Habits of Highly Effective Sales Engineer**


You are in sales not an engineer. You have engineer in the title but that is a sham. Do not have an engineer mindset despite probably being an engineer at heart. You are in sales. 

The ultimate goal of an SE, is the TECHNICAL WIN. The prospect should empathise and desire with the story we have told and the solution that we propose. 

The six habits are:

- Partner - Sales is a Team sport
- Probe - Technical Discovery
- Prepare - Content vs. Script
- Practice - Click Every Click
- Perform - Demo Best Practices 
- Perfect - Constant improvement

## 1 - Partner 


Remember that SEs’ and AEs’ have very different goals despite a constant need for collaboration. The relationship between an AE and an SE, akin to a marriage, is one of constant compromise. The AE wants as many big names, in a big room, in the shortest time frame to close out a deal whilst an SE takes a more cautious, slow and targeted approach. `

There are some mistake SEs’ tends to make. Sometimes we are too accommodation by saying yes to everything, without an awareness of how well the prospect has been qualified. In contrast to this sometimes we become roadblocks by showing resistance to demos. We should attempt to strike a balance between out bandwidth for demos and the demos that are being proposed. Ask yourself or the AE a few questions, the relationship between yourself and the AE? The AEs’ disposition? The account? The deal Size? The scope of the request? Becoming a no man is a surefire way to develop a bad reputation. 

How do we combat this? 
a) Get your mindset correct
b) Clarify roles and responsibilities
c) Follow a process

We should work alongside out AE similar to any team sport, there should be a constant push and pull and more flexibility to the role than is implied by the titles. The effective and efficient merging of skills allows you to bring the most to the table, 

Despite my earlier statement an important part of the relationship is to have clear cut roles (similar to a suburban americans household in the 60s, but a bit more PC, less dysfunctional... so nothing like a household in the 60s, but the clear division of roles remains). It should be a symbiotic relationship before anything. 

Ensure that you establish and follow a process. You don’t want your time to be wasted, you want ample time to prepare, work well qualified opportunities (but remain aware that some opportunities won’t be). List of touch points to collab with an AE on.



1. Customer Inquiry Review → Review customer situation BEFORE presentation & demo (Disco)
2. Technical Disco → Speak to customer regardless of what AE says
3. Demo Prep → Negotiate an ample amount of time to prepare for the demo
4. Logistics & Planning → If meeting requires travel, ensure adequate coordination/communication
5. Presentation & demo → Ensure demo aligns with what sales rep have and information from your discovery
6. Post-demo issues, questions & follow-up → Address these quickly
7. Post-demo discussion and lessons learned → Meet with reps to discuss, what worked, what did not and what needs to be changed. Be flexible with this but ensure it happens at some point in the future.
8. Product evaluation support → If there are any additional presales support materials provide that info (product eval, POCs, etc)


Things one should be curious about during a customer inquiry, internalise this list and use it to assess the opportunity. 

- Who are we talking to? What is their role/level?
- Are they technical? Management? Executive level?
- What are they trying to accomplish?
- How long have we been talking to them?
- Have they seen our product or a demonstration before?
- Are they current customers?
- Are they familiar with our product or have they seen or use a product like ours?
- Is there a third party or consultant involved?
- In what stage if the opportunity?
- Is there a budget and project tied to the opportunity?
- Are we talking to the decision makers?
- Are they on a timeline?

This would be considered due diligence. Assessing the level of engagement to determine how much energy should be given to a request. We want o dedicate more energy to higher priority leads. 

### 1 - Partner - Summary

→ Get the right mindset - Sales is a team sport
→ Discuss and clarify roles and responsibilities - With sales counterparts, sales manage and follow SEs
→ Map out a sales process - or review the sales process
→ Identify your responsibilities in each step of the process

## 2 - Probe 

Ensure we probe into the requirements of any request from the perspective of the customer. We should be figuring out what their objectives are. What are their requirements, constraints, expectations, previous experience, etc? This is done via disco.

The ULTIMATE purpose of the disco is to determine what is needed for the **SAY, SHOW, DO** (Tell, Show, Tell in SF). Is SSD/TST really necessary. Yes it is. If not for the technical disco we are going in blind to any customer and must pivot and contort on the spot in real time to meet their needs. This is asking for a fuck up and leaves much too much to chance. 

**Why can’t I just receive this information from an AE?** Similar to the last chapter an AE goals and your goals do not entirely overlap. Their perspective of the world differs. Sales reps hear what they’re trying to sell, whilst we hear what is needed for a technical win. A technical disco is extremely important and builds upon the message in the partner section where responsibilities have been clearly defined and roles assigned. Always ensure a disco is booked in. Analogy - When you pick up a newspaper you aren’t interested in the whole thing, rather you are interested in a specific section and will go directly to that. This is the same perspective a customer has on an issue. They want to get to the section that is relevant to them. Make sure your  expectations are aligned with the customers expectations.

We run a technical discovery to ensure that the customer gets the correct tool for getting things done. We need to assess what we know, not know and need to know. We know our product (hopefully), we don’t know the unique perspective of the customer, their business, culture, project, their objective, requirements, etc. We understand they’re considering our software so we can narrow it down but that doesn’t do a good job of narrowing it down at all. 

What do we need to know, what are we probing for. This information is required so that we don’t “show up and throw up”.

Things to look for during a technical discovery

Expect some pushback from reps when attempting to schedule a disco. They may have already qualified the opportunity and you’re just there to push the bells and blow the whistles. This is not the case. They may not want the customer to feel as if they’re being badgered, or another disco would make them look bad. 
To minimise the effect of this it is essential for us to do our homework, collect whatever information we can from the sales rep, dig around on corporate sites, Linkedin, and then once armed with all this information use it to bolster ourselves within the disco call.

#### Initial disco call execution

> *“<Mr. or Mrs. Customer>, my colleague Mike has given me some background on the project, and i understand you’re looking to accomplish XYZ. Since I will be the one on site to present our solution to you, I’d like to take just a few minutes of your time to ask you a few more questions to make sure that I fully understand what it is that you’re looking for from a technical perspective. That way, when I’m performing the demonstration, it will be the best use of your time. ”Is that an agreeable approach for you?“*


Remember, when you receive an answer from your customer you want the questions and answer to naturally cascade, linking back to what they’ve have previously said. Always remain cognisant of their previous statements and try to weave that into your goal. 

After approximately 3 - 6 question cascades. You’ll arrive at a specific requirement that can be mentioned during the demo. 



> “It sounds like you are trying to accomplish ABC, given (fill in blank) constraints, within (fill in blank) parameters, without having to do XYZ. Does it sound like I have that basically correct?”


Then establish empathy by letting them know other customers are doing similar things, generate hype with the possibility of a solution. Repeat if necessary. Sometimes you won’t have quite hit the nail on the head and it will be needed to dig deeper into a set of solutions. 

Sometimes, we learn that our solution probably isn’t entirely suited to their needs. We should not “ show your hand” right then and there, rather, continue the discover call and discuss the issue with the sales counterpart (Unlikely with SFDC suite). Clarify the thing that they need is “critical”, tell them you have thoughts on how to approach it and leave it at that. You may have to drop one thing but by continuing the discovery call you may discover other potential issues. The goal of the disco is to remain patients, prepare and collect as much information as possible. 

So when is the disco complete. Usually around 20 - 30 minutes, we should have a good sense of a few key questions. WHo’s going to be in the room, how much customisation is needed and have a very rough outline of what we should present. Sometimes, we can’t quite get all that information in 30 minutes? One should work on the effectiveness of their question, narrow the focus and driver the conversation in a more assertive manner. 

The biggest mistake SEs make when running the disco is hearing a key requirement that their software addresses and jumping into “sell and tell” mode. Harkening on about the ability of the software solution to do X, Y and Z. Don’t do this, it is a lost opportunity. The more the SE talks during the disco the less information is being collected.
