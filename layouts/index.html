          <h3>What’s the point of this site?</h3>
          <p>
            I started this to create a bit of a digital presence (No
            socials bar Linkedin). I’ve been meaning to write about random things
            for a while, and I got tired of my ideas/thoughts stacking up in my
            brain and gradually fading into nothing.<br>
            Also, writing is just a good skill to have! I don't write much as I've
            been on the STEM fast track, and during Uni all the writing I did felt
            like typing with my toes. This site is an attempt to develop that part
            of my brain a bit (not the toe typing part).
            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
              I enjoy travelling, keeping fit (
              <i>Boxing, Running, Calisthenics, Gym</i>
              ), philosophizing, learning and thinking about things like
              geopolitics, finance, crypto, urban/environmental sustainability,
              digital art, photography, software engineering, neuroscience,
              economics, technology, etc. When I'm not doing something related to
              those, I'm likely working on my own projects or going through my
